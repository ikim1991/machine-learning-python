# Machine Learning on Python

## Summary

This repository looks at several popular machine learning models used in industry today. We look at simple explanations of the algorithms without getting into all the advanced mathematics behind them.

There are 3 types of machine learning algorithms:
  - Supervised Learning: Working with labeled datasets
  - Unsupervised Learning: Working with unlabeled datasets
  - Reinforcement Learning: Working with no historical datasets

We will explore popular models of the 3 types of machine learning algorithms listed above using datasets from [https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning](https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning).

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning works with labeled sets of data where the target output is already known.
Within supervised learning, there are 2 types:
  - Regressions
  - Classifications

### Regression Supervised Learning

Regression algorithms are used to predict real numerical values. Some of the regression models are:
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Decision Tree Regression
  - Random Forest Regression

### Classification Supervised Learning

Classification algorithms are used to predict categorical values. Some of the classification models we explore are:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbor
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is used to predict structure or pattern in datasets when the target output is undefined. Unsupervised learning is also considered as clustering and the model we will explore is the K-Means Clustering.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is used when there are no historical data to work with. Instead the model learns based on trial and error based on real-time data. As time goes on and more data is fed into the model, it becomes smarter.

Some of the reinforcement learning models we explore are:
  - Upper Confidence Bound
  - Thompson Sampling

## Coming Soon

- Neural Network
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Dimensionality Reduction
